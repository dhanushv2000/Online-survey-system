surveys are created ,approved and are being conducted . This software helps
to store the data collected through the survey in which the survey
maker(Client) and the HR will be able to make the report of the survey.
This software allows Clients to fulfill their research
purposes, gather opinions of the common issues and etc. Survey\quiz is the very common
mode to learn about people and ideas.
Since random surveys are not being accepted, the HR department
checks the worth and quality of the survey or it rejects the survey. While the survey
quality of approval or rejection is being notified to HR and survey Maker
through an email from the system. User here has a simple role of attempting
the survey and viewing his response for that survey and can update his
